# BookaRoomApp
The project hotel booking app is a web-based application that allows the hotel manager and guests/users to handle all hotel activities online. Interactive GUI and the ability to manage various hotel bookings and rooms make this system very flexible and convenient. The hotel manager is a very busy person and does not have the time to sit and manage the entire activities manually on paper. 

**Features:**
    • Admin login and admin dashboard: It has admin login who has the authority of the system and he is responsible for approving and disapproving the users request for room booking. Admin can add and delete notifications and updates in the system.
    • User Registration: There is user registration form available where new users can create their account by providing required information to the system.
    • Booking System: User can request for the table booking for a particular date and time.
    • Approving/Disapproving Request: The booking requests are directly sent to admin account by the system. Admin can view all the requests along with respective user details and therefore make decisions for cancelling the requests.
